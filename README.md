## Why are the screenshots for Windows Phone so bad?
First of all, sorry for that. My PC is not the newest one, the CPU has no support for the Hyper-V virtualization required by the Windows Phone Emulator.
Even if I use my Lumia 930 for the screenshots, Microsoft is not happy. They want the screenshots in a resolution of 1280x768. So the screenshots I made on the phone have to be resized and stretched - so they look very ugly.
If I will get a new PC, the screenshots are getting updated.
