## Why are the screenshots for Windows Phone in the store so bad?
First of all, sorry for that. My PC is not the newest one, the CPU has no support for the Hyper-V virtualization required by the Windows Phone Emulator.
Even if I use my Lumia 930 for the screenshots, Microsoft is not happy. They want the screenshots in a resolution of 1280x768. So the screenshots I made on the phone have to be resized and stretched - so they look very ugly.
If I will get a new PC, the screenshots are going to become an update.
