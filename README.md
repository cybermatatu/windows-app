wallabag for Windows
================
**[Download it from the Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/app/wallabag/d5226cf1-f422-4e00-996c-88e9c5233332)!**
(*[Alternatively use the old app for WP7 devices.](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/wallabag/ff890514-348c-4d0b-9b43-153fff3f7450)*)

This is a windows app for [wallabag](http://wallabag.org).
The old wallabag app for windows devices was crap on new devices (Windows Phone 8 and newer), so I started a new one.

It's not perfect, but on a good way ;-)

Unlike the old app, this app is an universal app. Sadly, it only supports Windows Phone at the moment, but I am working on the Desktop app.

You can see the screenshots [here](/additional/screenshots/phone).

## Currently supported languages
- English
- German
- French

## Improve the app!
You can simply fork this repository and add some nice features to it.
And even if you're not a developer, **you can help to translate it!**

## ToDo
- [ ] more beautiful CSS (especially for lists, code and blockquotes)
