wallabag for Windows
================
**[Download it from the Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/app/wallabag/d5226cf1-f422-4e00-996c-88e9c5233332)!**
*[The old app for WP7 devices.](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/wallabag/ff890514-348c-4d0b-9b43-153fff3f7450)*

This is a windows app for [wallabag](http://wallabag.org).
The old wallabag app for windows devices was crap on new devices (Windows Phone 8 and newer), so I started a new one.

It's not perfect, but I think the main issues will be fixed soon.

Unlike the old app, this app is an universal app. Sadly, it only supports Windows Phone at the moment, but I am working on the Desktop app.

## Currently supported languages
- English
- German
- French

## Improve the app!
You can simply fork this repository and add some nice features to it.
And even if you're not a developer, **you can help to translate it!**

## ToDo
- [ ] Offline mode
- [ ] more beautiful CSS
- [ ] easily switch between articles (FlipView)
- [ ] Find a workaround for the bug (see below).

## Known bugs
If you're scrolling to fast on the single article page, the app crashes.
Sadly, I can't do anything because [it is Microsoft's fault](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/854abfa2-5312-4583-92d9-26430c7f5d9c/universal-app-webview-crashing-when-scrolling-windows-phone-81?forum=wpdevelop#006e77f5-474f-4162-8b90-86d4ea5c8d58).
The bug is fixed in OS version **8.10.14176.xx**, the current version on the user devices is **8.10.14157.xx**
