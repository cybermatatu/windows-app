wallabag is a self hosted read-it-later app. Unlike to other services, wallabag is free and open source. It's made for you to comfortably read and archive your articles.

You can download wallabag on wallabag.org and follow the instructions to install it on your own server, or you can directly sign up on framabag.org

This windows phone application allows you to read your bagged articles. You can also put a link in your wallabag instance.
